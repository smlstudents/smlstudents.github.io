<p>My name is Chryssie Karera, a graduate student at CMU Africa, currently interning at Volkswagen
Mobility Solutions Rwanda as part of the Carnegie Mellon University Africa summer internship
program. I would like to share insights and updates on how my internship has gone so far:</p>

<p><strong>Projects and Tasks</strong>: As a data analyst at VWSR, my main job is to work with data. My initial tasks
involved collecting data from different VWSR departments and transforming it into visual
representations to help the company understand its performance more easily. This was challenging
because of the large volume of data, and I had to identify the most meaningful indicators. This
required working closely with representatives from various departments to find the best metrics.
One significant analysis I conducted was identifying hotspot areas for ride-hailing services, breaking
it down by weekdays, hourly demand, and monthly trip numbers and averages. Additionally, I
collaborated with departments that have daily operations to automate their data collection
processes, which are now successfully in use. This task was complex as it involved understanding
their requirements thoroughly and ensuring that key performance indicators could be easily
measured with the new system.</p>

<p><strong>Skills and Technologies</strong>: Throughout my work, I had to find the best technologies to accomplish my
tasks. My skills in exploratory data analysis have significantly improved, especially as I worked with
various departments to meet their needs.</p>

<p><strong>Challenges</strong>: Every job comes with its challenges, and mine was no different. One of the main
challenges was aggregating data from different sources and finding a representation solution that
worked for all. Through persistence and experimentation, I eventually found a solution that was
well-received by the VWSR team.</p>

<p><strong>Memorable Experience</strong>: A memorable experience was presenting my work to the senior
management at VWSR after two months. The presentation was well-received and is now guiding the
team in implementing visual analytics solutions. Seeing the data collection solution I developed
being used in their daily operations boosted my confidence and demonstrated the impact of my
internship.</p>

<p><strong>Career Goals</strong>: This internship has been crucial in shaping my career goals. It provided me with
practical experience in applying data analysis skills learned at CMU and gave me exposure to working
with a leading organization in the transport sector, both in Rwanda and worldwide. Although I never
thought I would work in the transport sector, this experience has been incredibly motivating and has
inspired me to pursue a career in data analysis, aiming to contribute to decision-making and the
advancement of solutions using data as the main focus.</p>
